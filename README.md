# ‚úàÔ∏è Airport Travel Agency Platform

A C++ project simulating a flight reservation platform, developed as the final assignment for the *Advanced Programming* course. The system supports both admin and customer functionalities, including flight management, ticket booking, refunds, and more.

## üìö Project Overview

This console-based system models a travel agency with two main user roles:

- **Admin**: Manages all flights (domestic and international), with features to add, remove, and view flights.
- **Customer**: Can view available flights, top up their balance, purchase tickets, request refunds, and view their purchase history.

The program follows a class-based OOP design, with extensibility and clean code as core goals.
