# 🗨️ Bi-directional Chat Room

This project implements a simple terminal-based bi-directional chat room using sockets in C++. Both the client and server can send and receive messages simultaneously.

## 📚 Project Overview

This is a console-based application that enables real-time communication between a server and a client. It demonstrates fundamental concepts of socket programming and multithreading in C++ on Linux systems.

## ⚙️ How to Build

Make sure you have `CMake` and a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`, `clang`) installed on your Linux machine.

```bash
# Create and enter the build directory
mkdir build
cd build

# Generate build files and compile the project
cmake ..
make
